        <h1 class="mt-4">TYPES OF SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES</h1>
        <p>There is a general misconception about the term “social media”. Most people consider social networking
          websites like
          Facebook and Twitter once they hear the term “social media”, but this term refers to different websites that
          allow
          interaction among the users and therefore the passage of information through a different medium</p>

        <p>Depending on the sort of social profiles, social processes, sort of interaction, and sort of content being
          exchanged,
          six types of social media are established which are:

            within the sort of
            short or long blog articles.
          </li>
          <li>Content communities – Websites like YouTube, Vine, etc. where content is shared, after which users can
            interact by
            sharing impressions about the content.
          </li>
          <li>Social networking websites – This category includes the websites people are most ordinarily identifying as
            social media
            generally. Websites like Facebook and Google+ are in this category.</li>
          <li>Virtual game-worlds – one of the foremost popular websites during this category is World of Warcraft.
          </li>
          <li>Virtual social worlds – Game-like design allows users to make virtual identities and to interact with
            other users
            through a web platform.

        </ul>

        <h1 class="mt-4">6 Awesome Ways social Media Marketing can help beauty brands</h1>

        <h3 class="mt-4">1. Helps Build Awareness</h3>

        <p>People who don’t know about your business can’t become your customers. Social media provides a means of
          increasing your
          visibility among potential customers, letting you reach a large audience by employing a great deal of your
          time and
          energy. Here’s a fact: social media content gets attention. As you can see below, we were able to create
          awareness
          among1000 people with a single post.</p>

        <p>However, it’s really easy for a consumer to become overwhelmed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other
          social media
          platforms filled with noise from companies trying to promote their brands. How can a company create relevant
          content in
          such a crowded space? This is where you need the service of social media marketing experts. Determine what you
          want to
          achieve from social media to develop a social media strategy for brand awareness.
        </p>



        <h3 class="mt-4">2. Establish Your Brand As A Topical Authority</h3>

        <p>Topical authority means your business is a trusted & reliable source of information on a given subject or
          topic.</p>

        <p>So how does social media help in establishing your brand as topical authority? The more you provide helpful &
          relevant
          content on a given topic on social media, the more authoritative your page becomes, the more traffic you will
          get and
          the more search engines will pick your page as an authority on that subject.</p>
        <p>Making a positive first impression through social media shows that your business is trustworthy,
          knowledgeable, and
          approachable.</p>
        <p>Look for ways to demonstrate your expertise as a thought leader in your industry—like writing pieces related
          to your
          expertise or expanding on your company’s mission. By showing what your business offers and values, you will
          establish
          confidence in potential customers.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">3. Show Authenticity</h3>

        <p>Customers don't value businesses that publish dry, corporate-style social media posts.</p>
        <p>Instead, let your brand’s personality shine by being authentic in everything you share on social media.
          Communicate in
          your brand voice.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-4">4. Encourage Engagement</h3>
        <p>This simply means the possibility of the user taking part in a certain activity, such as liking, commenting,
          clicking,
          or sharing as a result of your encouragement. Social media encourages instant interaction, relationship
          building, and
          customer loyalty. As you represent a business on social media, your goal is to be active and engaging, to
          inspire your
          social media followers to do a certain action. The plan of activity on social networks should be created in
          such a way
          that it engages and inspires the audience which will help you reach them in a way that it is available on the
          specific
          social network.</p>
        <p>If a post is engaging, it means that users find it interesting, helpful, insightful, unique, etc. Having in
          mind that
          these kinds of characteristics define high-quality content, it is obvious that people are more likely to
          respond if they
          see value in a post.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-4">5. Boost Sales</h3>
        <p>Okay fans, here comes the best bet, arguably, the most important reason to use social media: you can make a
          huge amount
          of money selling your beauty products online. Sponsored info on timelines, videos with CTAs, cross-channel
          retargeting,
          and shoppable posts are the mainstay of social media.
        </p>
        <p>Marketing costs add up, and not every business can afford huge campaigns. But you will get a great deal of
          value in
          return with social media advertising. With ads on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, You can grow your
          business,
          regardless of its size. Even if platforms such as Instagram are primarily geared towards engagement, there are
          strategic
          ways to increase sales on these platforms geared towards engagement, there are strategic ways to increase
          sales on these platforms.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4">6. Provide Support</h3>
        <p>Social platforms have successfully collapsed the barriers between brands and their customers. Now, instead of
          calling a
          customer customer care line, many people turn to instagram, Facebook or Twitter to contact the business.
        </p>
        <p>Social media allows for immediate interaction and customer feedback. Businesses can also respond to their
          customers
          right away. Build a good reputation by offering great support through social channels.

        <p>One factor people take into consideration when searching is proximity i.e How close that listed business is

        <p>The one-time 7 pack has now been limited to 3 packs. Most brands try out different SEO tricks to appear on

          listed on this

        </p>

          GMB gives customers an avenue to review your product/ service for others to see. If you deliver quality
          service, reviews
          about your business will drive more customers to your brand. Reviews are important especially when the
